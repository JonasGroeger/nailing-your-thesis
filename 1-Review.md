- I like your introductory sentence. It makes it clear why the paper has been written in the first place.

- You wrote that "The case study is a research strategy..." which is not true. A case study is a report, focused on some particular issue. Case study _research_ is a research strategy that uses one or multiple case studies to explain a particular phenomenon. Maybe you just forgot to write "The case study __research__ is a research strategy..."

- You mention that "it is frequent to overlap [...] data analysis with data collection" but you fail to provide an explanation on why that is: You overlap them because upon data analysis you can reflect upon data collection and maybe change your process there. Note that in comparison to quantitative research one can freely change methods of data collection and analysis whereas in quantitative research this is not possible. There you stay at one method and follow that until the research is done in order to have comparability.

- You did good mentioning that conflicting cases can actually help and not hinder research.

- You structured your summary well. You had an easy to follow sentence structure and length.

- (Not affecting grade) Some words have capital characters where there should be none ("In all, Building ...", "... within-case Data ...").

- Again, very nice introductory sentence explaining the reason behind writing that paper.

- I miss the part about the challenges for reviewers in qualitative research. I will elaborate. Depending on where the researcher is coming from he might expect more storytelling or he might be confused by the large range of technical terms used in qualitative research. Therfore he might unfortunately not be able to adequately review the publication.

- Aside from the one, you covered all of my points and the points from class too. Very nice work.
